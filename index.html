              <h3>EDUCATION </h3>
              <p>South Sudan is the world's newst nation, and one of the world's most fragile states, years of war and violence mean education in South Sudan has been severely disrupted for generations. Only 27% of adults are literate and prospects for children are dire. What are the challenges for South Sudan? In South Sudan 70% of children aged between 6 and 17 have never set foot in a classroom, only 10% of children manage to complete primary education-one of the worst completion rates in the world. Smile Charities Christian Organization, we believe education is one of the best tools for breaking the poverty cycle, and do so within one generatio. However children hoping to access education in south sudan face many barriera to success.</p>

              <h3>AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT</h3>
              <p>The backdrop of longstanding conflict, desert locusts attack and COVID-19 and cattle raiding conflicting outbreak in South Sudan, is envisioned as a first step towars South Sudan breaking out of the cycle of humantarian assistance and progresssing to self-reliance. The focus is on agricultural recovery, resilience building and productivity enhancement. The project development objectives is to help farer bring more fallow land under cultivation,improve farm management practices,increase use of agricultural tools and machinery,production and availability of quality seed,reduce pre and postharvest losses,increase grain storage,incremental increase in crop production,higher consumption of nutritiouse food by local households, reduction in reliance on food aid, improvement in resilience and stimulation of local livelihoods, job and enterprises.  Environmental Protection(Climate changes) shocks undermine the agriculture and food system investment. According to the climate and disaster risk screening , the major climate risks facing South Sudan include floods,drought and heat. cLIMATE MODELS predict an average temprature increase of 1degrees by 2060 and a four percent increase annual increase in rainfall by 2050. The climate changes will also likely affect pest infestation patterns, damage crops,damage productive infrastructure and increase disease vectors. Resillience building is therefore critical so that the agriculture sector can recover  after the impact of shocks. The adaptive strategies include increased water use efficiency, water infrastructure for surface and subsurface storage improved varities selected for drought,heat and flood tollerance,the introduction of greenhouse and polytunnels, as well as training of farmers in climate smart agriculutral(CSA) technologies all of which will go along way towards building resillience to climate risks.</p>

              <h3>WASH</h3>
              <p>The 2018 Humantarian Needs overview reports that 90% of South Sudan's population has no access to safe sanitation, making it the country with the lowest access rates fewer than half of the country's primary schools have access to safe potable water and only 17 percent have acceptable latrines. In South Sudan the risk of contracting waterbone  diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, hepatitis ,typhoid, or guinea worms is one of the highest in the world. Water sanitation and hygiene(WASH) are linked in many ways. Poor hygiene, inadequate access to clean drinking water and lack of sanitation facilities cause millions of the people  to die from preventable diseases each year and children are particularly affected. In South Sudan one third of children under the age of five suffer from diarrhoea. Continuing conflict and neglect in the country have also made access to clean water scarce, a situation that often lead to intercommunity conflicts.  We will constrcut latrines to help reduce the spread of waterborne diseases especially for children. In partnership with local communities, wea are establishing fair water distrubution systems which will also cut down the high costs of buying drinking water as well as medical costs to treat preventable diseases. We also raising awareness on safe hugine and better sanitation to improve the overall health condition of vulnerable communities.</p>

              <h3>PROTECTION.</h3>
              <p>A year after the signing of the revatlised peace agreement on the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan(R-ARCSS), 1 the ceasefire holds in most parts of the country. Armed conflict between state security forces and opposition armed groups has been contained to a small number of areas in the Equatorians where and inter-communal violence,enabled by small-arms proliferation and weak rule of law. This is often driven by resource scarcity in areas that have experienced years of severe food insecurity. Overall progress on the implementation of R-ARCSS has been modest. The deadline for the parties to the agreement to form a transitional government of national unity has been extended twice most recently untill 2020,following regional mediation efforts aimed at preventing the country from slipping back into conflict. Delayed contonment of former fighters ,full intergration of forces, decisions concerning the number of states and their boundaries and unresolved issues between R-ARCSS signatories around security arrangements for the opposition are among the sources of uncertainity concerning the country's short-term future. This can affect displaced people's decisions about returnin to their places of origin or habitual residence. Although an estimated 1million people have returned from displacement inside South Sudan or from countries of asylum since November 2017, nearly 4 million people remain displaced by the humantarian crisis, 1.5million internally 3 and more than 2.2million as refuguees. Recent interviews with internally displaced people(IDPs) found tat beyound the continued threat of conflict, potential barriers to return included lack of safety services and livelihood opportunities in areas of return; the destrcution or occupation of former homes and lack of accountability for human rights violation committed during the war including sexual violence. 4 Intentions surveys with refuguees found lack of livelihoods, inadequate basic services, lack of political SSCO will coordinates humantarian protection activities for internally displaced persons returnees and (IDPs) on community protection, gender based violence, child protection, protection of civillians, rule of law, min action and land issues across the ten states of South Sudan.</p>

              <h3>CHURCH DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</h3>
              <p>South Sudan became independent in july 2011 and by December 2013 has been plunged into a civil war.By 12 Novemeber 2015, there were an estimated 1.66 million people displaced as a result of the conflict (UNOCHA situation report #82). The South Sudan IPC report (FSL and Nutrition cluster analysis, September 2015) estimates that 3.9 million people (34% of the population) are severly food and nutrition insecure and unable to meet their food needs.This is an 80% increase compared to the same period in 2014. This is attributed to a combination of factors ,including market disruption due to the continueing conflict, economic downturn followed by runaway inflation raates in the country ,insecurity and localised crop failures due to poor rainfall distrubution in 2015. The economic downturn has resulted in record high food prices(upto 150% compared to average) which has reduced the purchasing power of households across the country. With this background, it was decided to introduce the church and community mobilization process(CCMP) to gradually wean the population off its aid dependency and help them find a viable alternative to external assistance inorder to revive and develop. In order to archieve holistic ministry, the project involved local churches and communities in a relief intervention targeting families of malnorished children, women and youth which also included a scholarship for the orphans ,training for leaders, church planting,open air preaching, confrence training for women and youth and children ministry and peace message to the entire communities in South Sudan.</p>
